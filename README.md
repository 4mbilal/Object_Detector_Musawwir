# Object_Detector_Musawwir
A collection of object (originally pedestrian) detectors written in C++ (OpenCV). "Musawwir" means "Artist" in Urdu

This repo contains source codes for two pedestrian detectors.

1- Original HOG-Linear SVM (Navneet Dalal) Retrained: An improved bootstrapping algorithm gives up to 14% lower miss rate.

2- HSG-HIK: A low complexity feature-classifier framework which gives much better response than HOG-Linear SVM.
